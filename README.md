# Leaves (Unity Project)
Most comparable to the Wario Ware series of games, "LEAVES" has challenges the player with bite-sized minigames that last quick, and move on even quicker, eventually ramping up in speed and difficulty. Thematically, each minigame involves sentient house plants doing chores for their down-on-luck owner.
